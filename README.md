# pspaint

This is PSPaint.

## The Pitch

Think of AR MS Paint, where you paint the surroundings around you. A colored glove or an attachable marker on the finger with high contrast. The user can draw on the screen, using a button to start and stop the feed (or a tucked finger).

## The Proof

(basic mockup/tech things)

The functions:

- Simple drawing
- Color changing (draw over a palette on the side of the screen to change to a new color)
- Clear the image
- Possible extras:
  - Multiple pens??
  - Erasing
  - Change Background
    - White
    - Picture
    - Live Video Feed

## The Plan

<!-- (schedule, things to do, etc) -->

1. Design a finger target
1. Get tracking working
1. Plan out UI
1. Build UI
1. Add more changes
